# Playlist-C
This is a C prompt program that allows users to build and save playlists from spotify tracks

The user's playlists are saved inside /users/username and can be opened for visualization and to add more songs!
The program has 4 navigation states:

START: user enter his id and choose to create a new playlist or manipulate his saved playlists

CREATE: user create a new playlist 

ADD: user can search for tracks in the spotify database and add to his playlist.

MANIPULATE: user can open his playlists to see the content and add more songs to his playlists

Unfortunattely I could not add the song play functionality.

I used two libraries to complete the project:
libcurl library: https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl.html
jsmn library: https://github.com/zserge/jsmn
